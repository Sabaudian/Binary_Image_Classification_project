Use Keras to train a neural network for the binary classification of muffins and Chihuahuas.

## General Information

- Python version is: 3.10.5
- Scikit-learn version is: 1.3.1
- Tensorflow version is: 2.14.0

## How to Set your Workspace:
Download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification)
and put in inside your project folder.

### Example:
```
├── my_project_folder
│   ├── dataset
│   ├── classifier.py
│   ├── constants.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── etc.
```

If you want to just run it, the dataset it is not really necessary,
because in the **models** folder there are the saves of the models used in this project.
