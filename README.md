#### A. Preprocessing
In the preprocessing phase, the emphasis is on refining the dataset. The process involves systematically addressing corrupted files, detecting and managing duplicates through image hashing, and conducting a thorough dataset check.

#### C. Classification
In the classification phase, a robust image classification pipeline is established us- ing Keras and TensorFlow. The implementation introduces configurable models, in- cluding Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network and MobileNet. The workflow seamlessly integrates hyperparameter tuning and K-fold cross-validation for comprehensive model optimization.

#### D. Evaluation
In the evaluation phase, the modelâ€™s performance is systematically assessed through the presentation of insightful metrics, such as loss and accuracy. The module fur- ther generates detailed classification reports, produces confusion matrices, and offers intuitive plots for model predictions.
